Decision Trees & Random Forests - Heart Disease Prediction
Objective  
Apply and compare tree-based models for classification using a heart disease dataset.
Tools Used  
  Python  
  Pandas, NumPy  
  Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, metrics)  
  Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tasks Performed  
  1. Loaded and explored the `heart.csv` dataset  
  2. Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
  3. Visualized the decision tree  
  4. Controlled **tree depth** to handle overfitting  
  5. Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**  
  6. Compared models using **accuracy** and **cross-validation**  
  7. Analyzed **feature importance**
Key Learnings
  Understanding how decision trees split data  
  Using Random Forests to improve generalization  
  Visualizing model decisions and feature influence
